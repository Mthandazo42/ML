#ALGO SKELETONS

This folder contains code snippets illustrating the use of the 4 main
Machine Learning Algorithms i.e. Linear Regressions, K-Nearest Neighbour,
Convutional Neural Networks, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression. 

1) Linear Regression, KNN and Logistic Regression.
These three algorithms are explained through the use of a simple project which
has an aim of predicting the salary of an employee in a huge company.
This code snippet can be used as a skeleton for building projects with a
related goal, e.g predicting the price of a ticket for an artist before
the concert or predicting the price of a market commodity.

Datasets Used: Salary_Data.csv and SocialNetworkAds.csv 

2) Decision Trees
Decision Tree algorithm is explained through the use of a sample project
which aims at outputing the probability of a child suffering from
Kyphosis based on their age. This example illustrates the usefulness of
Decision Trees in the medical Sector. 

Dataset Used (kyphosis.csv)

3) Conv Neural Networks
CNN are explained through the use of 4 common projects which, House Price
prediction, movie sentimental Analysis and Image Recognition

DataSets Used Boston Housing Dataset, MNIST, imdb dataset and reuters

#OPENCV PROJECTS

This folder contains sample projects which all rely on the OpenCv framework.
From AgeGender Classifiers to Realtime Object Detection this folder has fully
functional code that can be cleaned and customized to fit a in real life
project.
